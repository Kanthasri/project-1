Introduction

In today’s academic environment, student feedback plays a vital role in assessing the
performance and overall effectiveness of educational institutions. Traditionally, analyzing this 
feedback—especially in free-text form—has been a time-consuming and subjective process.
This project aims to automate the classification of student feedback using machine learning 
techniques, specifically leveraging foundation models via IBM watsonx. By analyzing large 
volumes of open-ended responses, the system can categorize feedback into predefined themes such
 as Academics, Facilities, and Administration.
This not only helps in streamlining feedback analysis but also empowers educational 
administrators to make data-driven decisions, enhance campus services, and improve overall 
student satisfaction.

Objective
The primary objective of this project is to develop an AI-based feedback classification system that can accurately categorize student feedback into meaningful themes such as:
•	Academics
•	Facilities
•	Administration
By achieving this, the project aims to:
•	Automate the processing of large volumes of textual feedback.
•	Identify key areas that require improvement based on student sentiment.
•	Assist decision-makers in educational institutions to implement targeted actions.
•	Save time and reduce manual effort involved in analyzing open-ended feedback.
This system will serve as a valuable tool for continuous quality improvement in colleges and universities.
